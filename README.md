How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs and implement them by taking careful notes of what is needed and use trial and error in the coding to give life to the projects. 
Creating user stories helps by giving a general idea what is to be devloped. This helps by short cutting some of the thought process in creating the project.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs by first starting with psuedo-code. it is the most effective way to create the plan itself. 
I hope to incoratpe the scrum board in future development work. or at least a team i might be able to work with. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe what it means to be a good team member is to actually communicate and take care of your side of the work for what is needed and make sure you show up
on time for every meeting if you want to be taken and an actual team member.
